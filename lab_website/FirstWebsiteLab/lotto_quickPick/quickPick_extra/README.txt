First Part:

This extra exercise includes just adding in another field to capture the number of choices per line.

All that is required is to pass in an extra argument to the function, and use that argument in the for loop, which loops six times. 
It is hard coded to '6' on the previous exercise.

Second Part:

Do euro millions - so you can have 2 lucky star numbers along with the five per line.
